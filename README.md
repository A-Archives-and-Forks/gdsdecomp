# Godot RE Tools

## Introduction

![Code Screenshot](images/screenshot.png)

This module includes following features:

- Full project recovery
- PCK archive extractor / creator.
- GDScript batch decompiler.
- Resource text <-> binary batch converter.

Full project recovery performs the following:

- Loads project resources from an APK, PCK, or embedded EXE file
- Decompiles all GDScript scripts
- Recovers the original project file
- Converts all imported resources back to their original import formats
- Converts any auto-converted binary resources back to their original text formats
- Recreates any plugin configuration files

This module has support for decompiling Godot 4.x, 3.x, and 2.x projects.

## Installation

Grab the latest release version from here: https://github.com/GDRETools/gdsdecomp/releases

On Windows, you can also install it from [Scoop](https://scoop.sh):

```
scoop bucket add games
scoop install gdsdecomp
```

## Usage

### GUI

- To perform full project recovery from the GUI, select "Recover project..." from the "RE Tools" menu:

```

#### Notes on Include/Exclude globs:

- Recursive patterns can be specified with `**`
  - Example: `res://**/*.gdc` matches `res://main.gdc`, `res://scripts/script.gdc`, etc.
- Globs should be rooted to `res://` or `user://`
  - Example: `res://*.gdc` will match all .gdc files in the root of the project, but not any of the subdirectories.
- If not rooted, globs will be rooted to `res://`
  - Example: `addons/plugin/main.gdc` is equivalent to `res://addons/plugin/main.gdc`
- As a special case, if the glob has a wildcard and does not contain a directory, it will be assumed to be a recursive pattern.
  - Example: `*.gdc` would be equivalent to `res://**/*.gdc`
- Include/Exclude globs will only match files that are actually in the project PCK/dir, not any non-present resource source files.
  - Example:
    - A project contains the file `res://main.gdc`. `res://main.gd` is the source file of `res://main.gdc`, but is not included in the project PCK.
      - Performing project recovery with the include glob `res://main.gd` would not recover `res://main.gd`.
      - Performing project recovery with the include glob `res://main.gdc` would recover `res://main.gd`

Use the same Godot tools version that the original game was compiled in to edit the project; the recovery log will state what version was detected.

## Limitations

Support has yet to be implemented for converting the following resources:

- 2.x models (`dae`, `fbx`, `glb`, etc.)
- GDNative or GDExtension scripts

## Compiling from source

Clone this repository into Godot's `modules` subfolder as `gdsdecomp`.
Rebuild Godot engine as described in https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/compiling/index.html.

You will also need [rustup](https://rustup.rs) and [dotnet 9 sdk](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0).

For ease of bootstrapping development, we have included launch, build, and settings templates for vscode in the .vscode directory. Once you have read the instructions for compiling Godot above and set up your build environment: put these in the .vscode folder in the Godot directory (not gdsdecomp), remove the ".template" from each, and launch vscode from the Godot directory.

Note: Make sure to build the editor build first, and to launch the editor to edit the project in the `standalone` directory at least once so that resources are imported before running.

### Requirements

[Our fork of godot](https://github.com/nikitalita/godot/tree/working-branch) @ `working-branch`

- Support for building on 3.x has been dropped and no new features are being pushed
  - Godot RE Tools still retains the ability to decompile 3.x and 2.x projects, however.

### Standalone

Assuming you compiled with `scons platform=linuxbsd target=template_debug`,

```bash
$ bin/godot.linuxbsd.template_debug.x86_64.llvm --headless --path=modules/gdsdecomp/standalone --recover=<pck/apk/exe>
```
